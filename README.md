## 🧩 Main Building Blocks of Angular

Angular applications are built using the following core building blocks:

- **Components** – Define views and UI logic
- **Templates** – HTML with Angular directives and bindings
- **Services** – Handle data fetching and business logic
- **Dependency Injection (DI)** – Manages shared resources across components
- **Routing** – Enables navigation between views
- **Directives & Pipes** – Extend HTML behavior and transform data
- **RxJS Observables** – Handle asynchronous data streams

## 🎨 What is Angular Material?

**Angular Material** is a UI component library built specifically for Angular that implements Google’s Material Design.

With Angular Material, you can:

- Build responsive, accessible UIs quickly
- Use pre-built components like:
  - Toolbars
  - Cards
  - Buttons
  - Dialogs
  - Forms
  - Icons
- Maintain consistent design across the application
- Improve accessibility out of the box

In this project, Angular Material was used for dialogs, navigation, forms, buttons, icons, and layout.
